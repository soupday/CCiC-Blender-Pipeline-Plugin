# CC/iClone Blender Pipeline Plugin
**(Installed in CC4 and iClone 8)**

**This plugin is for Character Creator 4 and iClone 8, for Character Creator 3 [look here](https://github.com/soupday/CC3-Blender-Tools-Plugin)**

This is a python plugin for Character Creator 4 to re-import a character from Blender generated using the **CC4 Blender Pipeline Tool** auto-setup add-on: https://github.com/soupday/cc_blender_tools.

This plugin will re-import the selected character and reconstruct the materials exactly as specified in the character Json data, which is exported with all FbxKey exports to Blender.

The character export from Blender must be generated with the **CC/iC Blender Tools** add-on as the Fbx export must be carefully altered to be compliant with CC4 and having exactly matching Object and Material names with the FbxKey, and also must have all relevent texture paths updated and changes to the material parameters written back to the exported Json data.

It is possible to include additional objects with the character exports from Blender by selecting them along with the character, but they must be parented to the character armature and have an armature modifier with valid vertex weights, otherwise CC4 will ignore them.

Installation
============

### Upgrading
- **Important**: Remove **all** previous versions of this plug-in from the OpenPlugin folder.
    - Existing previous versions will cause conflicts with the current version and it _will not_ work correctly.
- Follow the Manual Installation procedure below.

### Manual Installation
- Download the Zip file (__CCiC-Blender-Pipeline-Plugin-main.zip__) from the [**Code** button](https://github.com/soupday/CCiC-Blender-Pipeline-Plugin/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
- Unzip the zip file. There should be a folder: **CCiC-Blender-Pipeline-Plugin-main**
- Create the folder **OpenPlugin** in the <Character Creator 4 install directory>**\Bin64\OpenPlugin**
    - e.g: **C:\Program Files\Reallusion\Character Creator 4\Bin64\OpenPlugin**
- Copy or move the folder CC4-Blender-Tools-Plugin-main into the **OpenPlugin** folder.
    - e.g: **C:\Program Files\Reallusion\Character Creator 4\Bin64\OpenPlugin\CC4-Blender-Tools-Plugin-main**
- The plugin functionality can be found from the menu: **Plugins > Blender Pipeline**

### Run Without Installing
- Alternatively the main.py script can run as a standalone script from the **Script > Load Python** menu.

Troubleshooting
===============

If after installing this plugin the plugin menu does not appear in Character Creator:

- Make sure you are using the correct version of the plugin for your version of Character Creator:
    - Character Creator 3: [CC3 Blender Tools Plugin](https://github.com/soupday/CC3-Blender-Tools-Plugin)
    - Character Creator 4 / iClone 8: [CC/iC Blender Pipeline Plugin](https://github.com/soupday/CCiC-Blender-Pipeline-Plugin)
- Make sure your version of Character Creator / iClone is up to date.
- If the plugin still does not appear it may be that the Python API did not installed correctly and you may need to re-install Character Creator from the Reallusion Hub.

Known Issues
============

- By default the FBX export settings have embed textures switched on, but this makes the export incompatible with re-importing the character back into CC4 as the textures are hidden in the original Fbx and are not accessible to the file system.
**Always turn off embed textures.**

- Hidden faces information for clothing and accessories is lost upon re-importing into CC4.
